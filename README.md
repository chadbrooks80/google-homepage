This repository is a google mockup homepage that is part of CSS and HTML section of the the "Web Development 101" portion of the program.

The purpose of this project is to practice and demonstrate my ability to:

1. use web development tools within Google Chrome to help learn how the page is outlined.

2. Create an actual mockup of the page, thereby practicing and demonstrating my ability to write HTML and CSS.
